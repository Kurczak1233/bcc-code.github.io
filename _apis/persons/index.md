# Getting Started
## Overview
- BCC supports a sandbox environment. This is an environment that is identical to production with the only difference being that it contains fictitious data. 
- You probable wants to start developing your app or integration on top of BCC's API's. The easiest way to get access to the BCC environment is to first request access to the sandbox environment. This will allow you to developer your solution. While development is in progress you can in parallel request access to the production environment.
## Get access to sandbox environemnt
1. Write a email to [it@bcc.no](mailto:it@bcc.no), your email should include the following information.
    - Name for you applications
    - Scopes you would like to get access to (provide link)
    - Reason for wanting access
2. BCC IT will respond to your request with OAuth2 Client Crendetials to BCC's sandbox environment.

## Get access to production environment
1. Request that your app gets added to production environment.

# Auth
