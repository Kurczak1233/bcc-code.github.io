# Getting Started
## Overview
BCC supports a sandbox environment. This is environment that is identical to production with the only difference being that it contains fake data. The easiest way to get access to the BCC production environment is to first request access to the sandbox environment. This will allow you to developer you solution completely. While you develop your solution you can in parallel request access to the production environment.
## Get access to sandbox environemnt
1. Write a email to it@bcc.no, your email should include the following information.
    - Name for you applications
    - Scopes you would like to get access to (provide link)
    - Reason for wanting access
2. BCC IT will respond to your request with OAuth2 Client Crendetials to BCC's sandbox environment.

## Get access to production environment
1. Request that your app gets added to production environment.
