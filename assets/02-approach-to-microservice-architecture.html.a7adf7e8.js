Reason: wide industry adoption. Zero-trust principle indicates that even internal services should authorize requests. Undecided: whether to use one or multiple audiences. For user-facing APIs one audience would allow a microfrontend approach to development with multiple backends (this could also be acheived using a proxy). For security, different audiences would be more optimal.</p><h3 id="communication" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#communication" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Communication</h3><p>Mandatory: APIs should at the very least support HTTP and publish an Open API <em>v2</em> specification (swagger). Reason: Widely supported by 3rd party tools, and sufficient to generate clients etc.</p><p>Optional: they may additionally support gRPC endpoints (esp. for internal communication) -- which MAY be achieved using Dapr</p><p>Recommended: APIs should publish business events to a shared message broker (internally) and via webhooks (externally). Ideally, webhooks API can be provided as an infrastructure service. Reason: support asynchronous, highly available and scalable workflows. Simpler to understand/implement than Event streaming.</p><p>To try: use Dapr as an abstraction for the shared message broker (pub/sub)</p><h3 id="documentation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#documentation" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Documentation</h3><p>The following needs to be documented for all APIs:</p><ol><li>Endpoints (swagger, gRPC, graphQL etc) including a description of the functionality provided by the endpoint</li><li>Error codes, status codes and Models for all endpoints</li><li>Models for asynchronous messages (Events, Commands, Requests etc)</li><li>Authentication scopes</li></ol><p>Recommended: develop SDKs in the most common languages (c#, node, perhaps GO) which make both the endpoints and models easy to consume.</p><h3 id="deployment" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#deployment" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Deployment</h3><p>Deployment of services should be highly automated including unit testing.
