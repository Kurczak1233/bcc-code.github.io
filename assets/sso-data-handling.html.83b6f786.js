Once the BCC login has exchanged this information with the website it loses control over the data which means that the website takes over the responsibility for what happens with this information in the future.</p><p>To get a bit more control over the above mentioned process, BCC has developed a plugin that can be installed in the website to manage this data.</p><p>If we take a specific case, for example with WordPress, then a WordPress website would install the BCC login plugin into their site and configure BCC login to work together with their site. When a user then logs in, the plugin then saves the user data to the WordPress database permanently, in order to create a session for the user. It is a known requirement to make this step configurable i.e. that the user can log in with BCC login but his data is never saved to the website, but as of today this has not yet been implemented.</p><hr><p>Next: <a href="protect-uploads-files">Protect Uploads files</a></p>',8),n=[o];function h(r,l){return t(),a("div",null,n)}const c=e(i,[["render",h],["__file","sso-data-handling.html.vue"]]);export{c as default};
