## Architectural Decision Log \(ADL\)

This is a collection of decisions (Architecture Decision Records) that have been made for BCC. 

Each document describes one decision and reflects what the pros and cons are, what other solutions were considered, as well as any additional background for the decision.

More about it [here](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) or [here](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record)

Each ADR consists of following sections:
- Context - architectural drivers, business cases
- Decision - the choice and the arguments
- Consequences - known issues which can occur because of chosen decision
- Alternatives - were there any other alternatives? why were they not choose
