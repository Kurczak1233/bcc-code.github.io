However, if there is a good case for SQL, that's fine too. With regard to hosting, preferably something main stream that can be purchased / managed via the big cloud providers. When modelling data make sure that only things that really are part of the object are nested there (e.g. a relationship probably shouldn't be nested since it is shared by two objects -- unless it was duplicated).  # Decision  - the choice and the arguments # Consequences  - known issues which can occur because of chosen decision # Alternatives  - were there any other alternatives? why were they not choose
